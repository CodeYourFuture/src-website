## General information

The WordPress Content Management System has been used to build the Refugee Festival Scotland website. It includes some custom functionality to create and manage current and previous Festival pages and  events.

This functionality can be seen in the pages with a title including the text  “What's On”.
So “What's On” would be the current year's festival programme page and “What's On 2017” would be the 2017 Festival Programme page.

To add or edit content to the website, you will need to login to the Dashboard.

To access the login page, go to <https://refugeefestivalscotland.co.uk/wp-login.php>
