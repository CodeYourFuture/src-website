## General information

The WordPress Content Management System has been used to build the Refugee Festival Scotland website. It includes some custom functionality to create and manage current and previous Festival pages and  events.

This functionality can be seen in the pages with a title including the text *“Programme”*.
So *“Programme”* would be the current year's festival programme page and *“Programme 2017”* would be the 2017 Festival Programme page.

To add or edit content to the website, you will need to login to the **Dashboard**.

To access the login page, go to <https://refugeefestivalscotland.co.uk/wp-login.php>

## Dashboard

*Illustration 1: the WordPress Dashboard*

After login, you will see a screen similar to that shown in Illustration 1.

The main sections have been highlighted by a red number and are as follows:

	1. **Posts** – posts are listed in reverse chronological order on the Stories section.
	2. **Pages** – the Festival programme pages all have the name “Programme YYYY” where YYYY indicates the full year. For further information, please refer to section 5: [How to create a new programme page](create-new-programme-page.md). Other examples of pages are *Home* and *About*.
	3. **Events** – the festival events, both for the current and the previous year's festivals. For further information, please refer to sections 3 and 4: [How to create a new event](create-new-event.md) and [How to edit an existing event](edit-existing-event.md).
	4. **Email Subscribers** – details of all people who have signed up to the mailing list via the form in the website footer. Find out more in section 7: [View or edit the Subscribers list](subscribers-list.md).
	5. **Widgets** - Two widgets are in use on the website, the Email Subscribers widget is in the Footer and the Search widget in the Header. The Search widget is only displayed when clicking on the Search icon by the top navigation bar. These can be viewed from the Appearance > Widgets menu option.
	6. **Privacy** - The Privacy Policy page is set from the Settings > Privacy menu option.
	7. Change **user password** and **Logout** - You can change your own password by clicking on your username in the top-right corner of the screen and selecting **User Profile**. To logout from the WordPress Dashboard, choose **Logout** from the same menu.
